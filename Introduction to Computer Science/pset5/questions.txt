1.  Return resource usage statistics for the calling process,  which is the sum of resources used by all threads in the process.
2.  16
3.  Because C requires passing structs by reference in functions, because by value, the size would be too big
4.  Speller.c reads words from the file, character by character, using a for loop to begin reading the first character of 
    the file, incrementing by one character until it reaches the end of the file. If the character is a letter or apostrophe,
    it is added to a word. If the word becomes larger than what we have defined as the largest word possible, the word is
    ignored. If the word has a digit, it is ignored as well.
    
    If a word still exists, it is counted, checked for spelling, and printed. The amount of time it takes to complete the
    checking is logged in ti_check.
5.  To be able to account for numerical inputs and other punctuation which we have deemed invalid.
6.  Because word LENGTH and DICTIONARY are # declared as constants (word is an array of LENGTH+1)
7.  I decided to use the tries, because I believe is the fastest way to do it. In each node I have a boolean to check if the word ends at that char or not, and a children node for each of the chars again.
8.  Well the difference between the first and the last run was about 0.01s
9.  Declaring and deleting some variables depending of my need.
10. Actually I am pretty curious of how your loader is so much "faster" (0.02s);
